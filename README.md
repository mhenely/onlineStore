<b>Getting Started</b>:

Welcome to my online store! This guide will help you get started using my website. It is hosted at https://magnificent-gaufre-911888.netlify.app; however, the website is marked by Google as dangerous due to the existence of my sign in/sign up page. If you would like, you can still access the website by ignoring Google's warning. It is not necessary to sign in to access the rest of the website's functionality. Alternatively, follow the steps below to locally host the application.

## Quick Start:

<b>Steps:</b>

1. Clone the repo and run npm install

2. run npm dev for local hosting
